# Code

Code for training and testing classifiers for various target decision boundaries. A `sample-notebook.ipynb` is provided to get familiarized with the code.

The main functions for generating training data and training/testing classifiers are in the `classifier_utils` folder. Functions for simulating forward dynamics are in `fh_utils`. The `analysis` folder contains functions for performing additional analysis on the trained parameters and test data, like a clustering analysis and a function for determining a viable reservoir composition. The `gen_utils` folder contains functions for producing helpful plots.
